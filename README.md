## Overview
This website is both a old style text based game and a good starting point for those interested in learning about the Warhammer 40k universe. 
Containing both information and a look into the Universe; who are the factions that populate it and the interactions between them.
With a minimalistic user interface and a space theme with both background and dark colours it emanates the grim-dark theme of the setting.

#### Information Design
- Information for each faction is dynamically obtained depending on which faction is selected.
- Information layout is structured in a linear format, sub heading and information text.
- Navigation and background information are represented using a smaller text box pinned to the bottom of the screen,
- The game information is displayed in its own text box providing background and with an image below representing the situation.

#### Interface Design
- Images are used as selectors for both the main page and information pages of the site. Reducing page clutter and alowing easy interaction.
- The game interface is basic with clear well structured options. With question and answers split with an image between them.

#### Navigation Design
- Navigation is located at the top of the page, with three options.
- The navigation links are text even at smaller screen sizes so the user will know what option to select if they need more information.
