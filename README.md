[Visit My Site Here](https://ibrazyi.github.io/Javascriptus-Crusade/)

## Overview
This website is both a old style text based game and a good starting point for those interested in learning about the Warhammer 40k universe. 
Containing both information and a look into the Universe; who are the factions that populate it and the interactions between them.
With a minimalistic user interface and a space theme with both background and dark colours it emanates the grim-dark theme of the setting.
